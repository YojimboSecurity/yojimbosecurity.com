* IEEE 802.11

** IEEE

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.


*** Committees

The IEEE is separated into various committees. The "802" committee develops 

+ Local Area Network (LAN) 
+ Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

The most well known standards include 

+ Ethernet 
+ Token Ring
+ Wireless LAN
+ Bridgeing 
+ Virtual Bridged LAN

The IEEE specifications map the 2 lowest OSI layers that contain the physical and 
link layers. The link layer is further subdivided into 2 sub-layers called 

+ Logical Link Control (LLC) 
+ Media Access Control (MAC).

** Detailed Protocol Descriptions

*** IEEE 802.11

+ Direct-Sequance Spread-Spectrum (DSSS)
+ Frequency Hopping Spread-Spectrum (FHSS)
+ Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) as medium access method

*** IEEE 802.11b

+ Complementary Code Keying (CCK)

Devides band into 14 overlappi chanels. Each of these channels has a width of 22 MHZ

| Channel | Central Frequency GHz |
|       1 |                 2.412 |
|       2 |                 2.417 |

+ only 3 non-overlapping channels

+ USA 1-11
+ Europe 1-13
+ Japan 1-14


*** IEEE 802.11a

Uses 5 GHz band which has 2 major advantages

+ 2.4 GHz band is extreamly crowded

+ 5 GHz has more channnels and do not overlap

- Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

*** IEEE 802.11g

Same signal modulation as 802.11a but on 2.4Ghz
Signal range is slightly better than 802.11a
backwards commpatible with IEEE 802.11b 802.11g

*** IEEE 802.11n

+ Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)

Uses multiple antennas each with its own transmitter and reciever

+ Greenfield mode that introduces a new preamble for 802.11n where only devices operating
802.11n will be "allowed" on the network

* Wireless Networks

** Wireless Operating Modes

+ Infrastructure
+ Ad-Hoc

- Service Set Identifier (SSID) is required for notwork verification

+ Infrastructure
  - AP sets SSID
+ Ad-Hoc
  - Station crestion Network sets SSID

AP broadcasts the SSID and the client does as well once joined.

*** Infrastructure Network
