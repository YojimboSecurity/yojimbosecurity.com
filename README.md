# Yojimbo Security Blog

This is my blog https://yojimbosecurity.com I also have https://yojimbosecurity.ninja
you will find both have a lot of the same content. I write my notes in emace's 
org-mode. Org-mode also has https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html. This is 
how I write and publish my work. The .com is simple and .ninja is more flashy.
